En este caso, el accuracy de los tres modelos es de 0.94. Esto porque si bien se obtienen buenas m칠tricas para los jugadores que no son seleccionados y malas para aquellos que s칤 lo son, dado que el n칰mero de muestras de la clase de no seleccionados es mucho mayor que la de selecccionados, entonces se hace un efecto invisibilizador de la clase mayoritaria sobre la minoritaria.\n","En segundo lugar, el valor de precisi칩n indica la proporci칩n de verdaderos positivos y el n칰mero total de valores clasificados como positivos. Aqu칤, para la clase negativa se obtiene un valor de 0.94 en todos los modelos, mientras que para la clase positiva se obtiene un 0 en SVC lineal, 0.5 en Kneighbors y 0.67 en RandomForest. Estos no son buenos resultados, pues indican que en SVC lineal 0 de las muestras clasificadas como positivas eran realmente positivas. Por otro lado, Kneighbors indica que el 50% de las muestras clasificadas como positivas eran realmente positivas. Y finalmente, en Random Forest solo el 67% de las muestras clasificadas como positivas son realmente positivas.\n","Por 칰ltimo, el valor de recall indica la proporci칩n de verdaderos positivos que son correctamente clasificados sobre todos los valores que son positivos. En este sentido, nuevamente el valor obtenido por SVC lineal es de 0. Luego el valor de Kneighbors es de 0.06, y finalmente el de Random Forest es de 0.09. Esto significa que muchos de los jugadores seleccionados no se est치n identificando correctamente.\n","\n","Existen muchas formas de mejorar estos resultados. \n","\n","En primer lugar, se podr칤a obtener m치s datos, especialmente de la clase positiva, de manera que los datos se encuentren m치s balanceados. Por otro lado, se podr칤an aplicar t칠cnicas de oversampling que ayuden a balancear las clases, ya que el que la clase positiva tenga tantos menos valores que la clase negativa no permite que el modelo pueda obtener la informaci칩n suficiente de la clase minoritaria.\n","Con respecto a los modelos, se podr칤a explorar el ajuste de los hiperpar치metres de los algoritmos de manera que se ajusten mejor a los datos que se tienen. Adem치s, existen otros modelos dentro de ensemble learning que podr칤an utilizarse para intentar obtener mejores m칠tricas.\n","\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"5aa0cc14dba04749ad3bc07a92d351d2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"ix97Ho4uOARH"},"source":["## 1.2 Predicci칩n de posiciones de jugadores [2 puntos]\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1rfA1aWEAYU6Ny.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"6cd2eee12b6147bc8eba66af43a1f1f7","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"oHAwZfV8hMsk"},"source":["En una nueva jornada de desmesuradas transacciones deportivas, Renac칤n escuch칩 a sus colegas discutir acerca de que el precio de cada jugador depende en gran medida de la posici칩n en la cancha en la que juega.
